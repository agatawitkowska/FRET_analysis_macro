based on GUV membrane linearization macro, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.376618

This macro was developed by Agata Witkowska for the study
"A convenient protocol for generating giant unilamellar vesicles containing SNARE proteins using electroformation", Witkowska, Jablonski, and Jahn, 2018, Scientific Reports
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-27456-4

This Fiji macro can be used for automatic calculation of FRET donor signal recovery upon acceptor photobleaching in lipid mixing experiments with GUVs (as in Witkowska & Jahn, 2017, doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2017.03.010; and Witkowska, Jablonski, and Jahn, 2018, doi:10.1038/s41598-018-27456-4) in multiple microscopy image stacks (1 GUV on image present). It saves list with membrane fluorescence intensity over time for each image and a Log file with % donor change after photobleaching, file name, and GUV diameter.
